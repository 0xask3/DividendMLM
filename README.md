So there will be 3 packages—

let's say

5 BNB, 10 BNB, 20 BNB


user can buy any of these, as per there budget. 

60% of each buying is locked inside the smartcontract. 
out of 40% —
15% goes to a particular wallet (which will split among marketing, admin and development) - instantly
10% is shared among all buyers (of respective package).==> map this amount , as it will be available to claim every 6 hours.
5% — sent to reserve wallet ( which can be used for bug bounty, lottery or further rewards)
10% to referalls —
                  5% to direct referall
                  1.5%- 2nd level downline
                   1%- 3rd level downline
                  0.7%- 4th level downline
                  0.6%- 5th level downline
                   0.5%- 6th level downline
                   0.3%- 7th level downline
                   0.3%- 8th level downline
                     0.1%- 9th level downline


Users can buy each package (Plan) number of time, they can claim 60% of what they deposited (after lockupeprioddaysEnd).. once they withdrawn 60% of deposit (apart of regular claim, that they will get).

they will be out from game.
